You are an expert product designer, learning-science engineer, and senior full-stack Python developer who specializes in building beautiful, gamified learning apps that deploy reliably with minimal user effort.

Build me a complete, production-ready interactive training app to master “The Strat” trading methodology (visual price-action pattern recognition). The app must be extremely visual: the user should never have to imagine anything. Every question must show a chart.

CRITICAL DELIVERY REQUIREMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- Deliver the result as ONE single downloadable ZIP archive.
- The ZIP must contain a complete GitHub repository.
- I should NOT have to write code, copy/paste code, or manually create files.
- The repo must deploy cleanly on Streamlit Cloud.
- Output ONLY the ZIP file as your final output.

DEPLOYMENT & SHARING:
- Platform: Streamlit (Python)
- App must run with: `streamlit run app.py`
- Include `requirements.txt`
- Include a clear README with step-by-step instructions:
  1) Create a GitHub repo
  2) Upload the ZIP contents
  3) Deploy on Streamlit Cloud
- Deployment must be **PUBLIC and shareable via URL** (no login required for viewers).
- Treat the public URL as “unlisted” (only accessible if someone has the link).
- No authentication required.

PRIMARY GOAL:
Teach The Strat from absolute basics → full mastery using a step-by-step progression. The app must:
- Measure mastery per topic
- Automatically level the user up when mastery is achieved
- Allow manual review of any topic at any time
- Always generate NEW examples (never reuse the same question)
- Give more practice when the user struggles or self-identifies as “not mastered”

CURRICULUM (LOGICAL, MASTERY-GATED PROGRESSION):
Stage 1 — Core Language
1) Strat candle types: 1 (inside), 2U, 2D, 3 (outside)
2) Sequences of candles (bar-by-bar classification)
3) Visual context: trend vs chop

Stage 2 — Continuity
4) Timeframe continuity (single timeframe)
5) Multi-timeframe continuity (synthetic higher/lower TF alignment)
6) Full vs partial continuity and conflicts

Stage 3 — Setups
7) Inside bar (1) breakouts
8) 2-1-2 reversals
9) 3-2-2 reversals
10) 1-2 continuations
11) Failed setups / false breaks (confusers)

Stage 4 — Execution
12) Entries (break vs retrace)
13) Stop placement (invalidations)
14) Targets (R-multiple logic using synthetic volatility)
15) Risk sizing scenarios
16) Trade management logic

Stage 5 — Mastery
17) Mixed-mode exams
18) Timed recognition drills
19) Confuser pack (edge cases designed to trip users up)

MASTERY SYSTEM:
- Track mastery per topic using:
  - Accuracy
  - Consistency (recent streak)
  - Difficulty weighting
  - Confidence calibration
- Automatically level up when mastery threshold is reached
- Large neon + 8-bit celebration on level-up
- Allow user controls:
  - “I don’t feel mastered yet” button
  - Manual review of any topic
  - Reset topic mastery if desired

QUESTION STYLE (STREAMLIT-RELIABLE ONLY):
IMPORTANT: Avoid fragile click-on-chart or drag interactions.
Use ONLY highly reliable interaction patterns.

Include:
1) Multiple-choice questions (A/B/C/D)
2) “Select the correct entry / stop / target” using:
   - clearly labeled candidate zones on the chart
   - user selects the correct zone via buttons
3) Timed mode (optional countdown)
4) Confidence rating after every answer:
   - Low / Medium / High
   - Used in mastery scoring
5) Reasoning reinforcement:
   - short “why” explanations after feedback

FEEDBACK:
- Correct answer:
  - Immediate positive reinforcement
  - Neon glow animation
  - 8-bit arcade sound
- Wrong answer:
  - Show the SAME chart again
  - Overlay highlights and annotations
  - Explain why the correct answer is correct
  - Explain why the chosen answer is wrong
- Include “Show rule” button revealing the definition visually

SYNTHETIC CHART GENERATION (NO INTERNET):
- Generate synthetic OHLC data in-app
- Use intentional construction:
  - Do NOT rely on random chance
  - Ensure each chart cleanly represents the intended concept
- Difficulty tiers:
  - Easy (obvious)
  - Medium (subtle)
  - Hard (confusers designed to trick)
- Always generate NEW examples (different seeds every time)

VISUAL DESIGN (VERY IMPORTANT):
Theme: 1980s NEON ARCADE
- Dark mode only
- Candles:
  - Hot pink (bullish)
  - Neon yellow-green (bearish)
- Background:
  - Black / deep purple
- Accents:
  - Neon cyan, magenta glow
- Subtle CRT scanline effect (CSS)
- Large, readable, high-contrast UI
- Arcade-style typography (use locally packaged font if needed)
- Polished but not cluttered

SOUNDS (REQUIRED):
- Vintage NES-style 8-bit sounds
- Generate sounds programmatically (square/sine waves)
- Sounds needed:
  - Correct answer “coin/ding”
  - Wrong answer “soft bump”
  - Level-up fanfare
  - Streak milestone chirp
- Include sound ON/OFF toggle in settings
- Sounds must work in Streamlit using HTML audio

GAMIFICATION:
- XP
- Levels
- Streaks
- Combo multipliers
- Badges
- Daily challenge mode
- Progress dashboard showing:
  - mastery by topic
  - weak areas
  - confidence calibration

PERSISTENCE (SIMPLE & RELIABLE):
- Store user progress using Streamlit session state
- Persist progress in the user’s browser (client-side storage) so refreshes don’t erase progress
- Include:
  - “Export progress” button (downloads JSON)
  - “Import progress” button
- Do NOT require accounts, databases, or external services

PERFORMANCE & RELIABILITY:
- Keep charts lightweight (short windows)
- Cache generated assets
- Avoid heavy animations
- Ensure fast load times on Streamlit Cloud

WELCOME / PRESS START SPLASH (REQUIRED):
- On first launch, show a full-screen arcade splash:
  - Title: “THE STRAT ARCADE”
  - Subtitle: “Train your eyes. Level up. Become inevitable.”
  - Large neon “PRESS START” button
  - CRT scanline effect
  - 8-bit start sound
- Include a short visual “How it works”:
  1) See a chart
  2) Answer the question
  3) Get feedback and level up
- After pressing start, run a 3-question interactive tutorial:
  - Candle identification
  - Entry/stop/target selection
  - Confidence rating
- End tutorial with a celebration and badge
- Store “tutorial completed” status per user

ENGINEERING:
- Clean repo structure
- Clear comments
- Type hints
- No external APIs
- No copyrighted assets

FINAL OUTPUT:
- Output ONLY the ZIP repository artifact.
- The ZIP must be immediately deployable.
